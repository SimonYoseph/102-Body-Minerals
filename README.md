# 102-Body-Minerals
C++ program to inform individual of the 102 body minerals.

I wanted a way to find an easier method of what body minerals can help a specific part of th body and what food it can be found. The user can do so by 
searching either by body part or by a specfic body mineral. 

This program was written in C++ completely and research was involved since the minerals could help more than one body part. Also there are 102
body minerals so being able to access information in a convient way is beneficial for the user.

This all started when I wanted to learn more about the 102 body minerals and had to go to many different resources to find information. So what I did was 
gather the information and input the data and information into my program in order to create ease of access to the information.
